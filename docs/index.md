# Introduction

This site contains the documentation for the `trallala` project. 
`trallala` is a library aiming to provide a more
computer science oriented view on music theory. e.g., everything in
`trallala` can work with semitone steps to archieve an array-like access to
and definition of music objects. The usage of intervals is possible but optional.
